Tokugawa Iemitsu (1604–1651) was the third shogun of the Tokugawa dynasty. He was the eldest son of Tokugawa Hidetada, and the grandson of Tokugawa Ieyasu. Iemitsu ruled from 1623 to 1651; during this period he crucified Christians, expelled all Europeans from Japan and closed the borders of the country, a foreign politics policy that continued for over 200 years after its institution. It is debatable whether Iemitsu can be considered a kinslayer for making his younger brother Tadanaga commit suicide by seppuku. Iemitsu also had well-known homosexual preferences, and it is speculated he was the last direct male descendant of Tokugawa Ieyasu, thereby ending the patrilineality of the shogunate by the third generation.

As an artist though, his suibokuga, or ink paintings, show Tokugawa Iemitsu in different, perhaps meeker, light. Accordingly, Iemitsu enjoy painting as a hobby during his rule. And he had occasionally been known to gift his work to his subordinates. Because they were created by the shogun, the works were revered and closely guarded. Less than 10 paintings have been discovered. Iemitsu appears to have intentionally ignored the set norms of ukiyoe that had been established during those times and created unique, differentiated works. They appear cute, weak and with expressions of innocence, which contrast starkly with the actions and persona of the leader.
