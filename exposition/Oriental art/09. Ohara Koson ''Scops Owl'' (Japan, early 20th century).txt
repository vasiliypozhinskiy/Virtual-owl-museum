Ohara Koson (1877–1945) was a Japanese painter and print designer of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, part of the shin-hanga ("new prints") movement. NL NL
He was born Ohara Matao; it is thought that he started training in painting and design at the Ishikawa Prefecture Technical School. He also studied painting with Suzuki Kason. In Tokyo, he produced some ukiyo-e triptychs illustrating episodes of the Russo-Japanese War, but most of his production was prints of birds-and-flowers (kacho-e). NL NL
Through his association with Watanabe, Ohara's work was exhibited abroad, and his prints sold well, particularly in the United States. He was active designing prints until at least 1935, and died at his home in Tokyo in 1945.
