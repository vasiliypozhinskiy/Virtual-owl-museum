Yukio Katsuda was born in Kyoto in 1941 and since the 1960s has been active in the medium of serigraph (silk screens). His prints usually carry no title other than a number that represents the chronological order of his works, however, the verso of framed prints sometimes carry official paper notes with conventional titles in Japanese. His prints are often heavily inked, and thus have a unique, near-3D appearance. His major works cover natural themes such as birds (mostly owls), flowers and plants, and landscapes. NL NL
An outstanding element of Yukio Katsuda's artistic technique is the fine way the artist captures both light and textures through successive serigraphic printings. Almost a form of complex stippling, this approach appears to render a three-dimensional form in a two-dimensional space. This is clearly seen in the owl depicted in this picture.
