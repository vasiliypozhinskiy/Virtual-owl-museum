Full name of the picture is ''Nushirvan Listening to the Owls on the Ruined Palace''. NL NL
The miniature illustrates the plot of "Nushirvan and owls" from Nizami's poem "Treasury of Mysteries". One day the Sasanian king Nushirvan, attracted by hunting, moves away from his retinue. Accompanied only by one of the viziers, the king rides up to the ruined village; on one of the ruined walls they see two owls. The screams of the owls that resounded over these terrible ruins make the king uneasy, and he asks the vizier what they are talking about. The vizier replies that one of the owls is giving her daughter in marriage and is demanding this ruined village and several other similar villages from the surrounding area as payment. Another replies that it will not be difficult to fulfill this request, because as long as king Nushirvan lives, the people will continue to be poor and impoverished, and therefore there will be no shortage of ruined villages.

Here the poet, through the mouth of a wise vizier, denounces the abuses and injustice of the sovereigns of the past, in an allegorical form calling on the rulers of his day to be just, to give the people freedom and prosperity. The meaning of the life of kings, according to Nizami, is not in feasts, hunting and pleasure, but in serving the people and glorifying themselves with good deeds. NL NL
The palace wall is inscribed: ''Erected in the deserted heart of those deprived of happiness, there is no better edifice than this.''
