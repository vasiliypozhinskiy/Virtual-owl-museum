Ueno, who chose the word "Makoto" as his creative pseudonym, which means "Truth", is one of the leading masters of Japanese "folk engraving". Back in the thirties, when Ueno was just beginning to become famous as a graphic artist, critics singled out his series of works dedicated to the common people of Japan: "Loader", "Collector of rags", "Flutist", "Blind", "Woodcutter". The war brought a new big theme to the artist's work – the theme of the tragedy of thousands of people who fell victims of the American atomic bombings, the theme of the struggle of life against death, light against darkness. After the war he became a full-time printmaker, remaining true to his communist convictions, and exhibiting in many communist countries. He is well-known for a series of woodblock prints about the atomic bomb explosions in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. NL NL
Ueno likes and often depicts birds. They always act as an expression of spontaneous, free movement, the personification of the natural principle, a symbol of vital forces.
