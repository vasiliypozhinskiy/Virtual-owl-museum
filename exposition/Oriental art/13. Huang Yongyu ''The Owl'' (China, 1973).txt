Internationally acclaimed Chinese painting master Huang Yongyu is known for his woodblock prints, ink paintings and literary works. A multi-talented man, Huang has published poems, essays, novels, screenplays and photo albums. Born in 1924 in Fenghuang, Hunan Province, Huang never went to a regular art school but he had talent and worked hard. He studied art and literature by himself and learnt from friends, society and life. Perhaps this is why he shows such initiative and vitality in his works without any set pattern. NL NL
Since the 1970s, Huang has produced an abundance of coloured ink paintings depicting landscapes, flowers and birds using freehand techniques. His fresh themes, bold strokes and dripping colours combine to make an original style in contemporary Chinese painting; while his unique style of using traditional Chinese painting techniques helped contribute to his fame.

Huang Yongyu was harshly criticized in 1974 and reprimanded for his winking ''Owl'' painting for its purportedly blasphemous animosity towards the Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the Socialist system. The artist’s ''Owl'' was flagged as part of the ''Black Painting Exhibition'' held at China’s National Art Gallery in Beijing, as an example of being counterrevolutionary. The Gang of Four interpreted the winking owl as the artist’s portrayal of public officials turning a blind eye to wrong doings. For this, Huang Yongyu was harshly reprimanded for three and a half years laboring at a reform camp. NL NL
One art historian wrote: ''Obviously, the verisimilitude to nature was ignored – owls often close one eye – but the entire Black Paintings concept was like Alice in Wonderland nonsense''.
