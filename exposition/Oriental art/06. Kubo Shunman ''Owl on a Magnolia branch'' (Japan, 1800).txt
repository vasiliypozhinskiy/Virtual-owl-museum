Kubo Shunman (1757–1820) was a Japanese artist and writer. He produced ukiyo-e prints and paintings, gesaku novels, and kyoka and haiku poetry. Shunman tended toward boldly florid colours in his prints, and adhered to the beni-girai ("red-hating") trend of avoiding reds and other flashy colours. NL NL
The picture shows Blakiston's fish owl (Bubo blakistoni), the largest living species of owl. It is a fish owl, a sub-group of eagle owls which specialize in hunting in riparian areas. This species is a part of the family known as typical owls (Strigidae) which contains most species of owl. Its habitat is riparian forest, with large, old trees for nest-sites, near lakes, rivers, springs and shoals that don't freeze in winter. Henry Seebohm named this bird after the English naturalist Thomas Blakiston, who collected the original specimen in Hakodate on Hokkaido, Japan in 1883. NL NL
The Blakiston's fish owl feeds on a variety of aquatic prey. The main prey type is fish, with common prey including pike, catfish, trout and salmon. Some fish these owls catch are quite large. Jonathan Slaght estimated that some fish caught are up to two to three times their own weight and has seen owls keep one foot on a tree root to be able to haul a large catch onto a bank.
