Iwao Akiyama (1921–2014) was a Japanese woodblock printmaker and artist known for distinctive prints of owl and other animals. Akiyama was born in 1921 in Takeda, Oita Prefecture, on the island of Kyushu. He studied drawing under the direction of a Buddhist monk during his childhood. The monk, who was also an artist, worked in the traditional technique of "Sumi-e" – monochrome ink painting. Iwao Akiyama originally pursued oil painting. However, Akiyama changed his focus to woodblock printing after meeting Shiko Munakata, under whom he studied from 1959 until 1965. NL NL
The owl in Japanese folklore is a negative character, considered a symbol of infidelity and a harbinger of death. In Japanese and Chinese legends, an owl kills or betrays its parents. The opposite of an Owl is a Raven – a messenger of the gods, a symbol of happiness and an example of ancestor worship. Owls in Akiyama's work are not evil at all, but rather melancholy, clumsy or funny, and their opposition to crows is made with humor and is a reinterpretation of the traditional image of owls in Japanese folklore.
