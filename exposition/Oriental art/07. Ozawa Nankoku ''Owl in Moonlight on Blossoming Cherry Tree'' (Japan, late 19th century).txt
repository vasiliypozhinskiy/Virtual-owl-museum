The artist Ozawa Nankoku studied painting with Okamoto Shuki (1807–1862), who specialized in flower-and-bird painting in Chinese-inspired styles. In this work, however, Nankoku takes an independent and modern approach to a traditional subject. Instead of following the conventional formulas of meticulous brush techniques and formulaic compositional arrangement that usually characterize flower-and-bird subjects, Nankoku has placed the bird in a stark, natural setting and delineated the features of the owl in a strikingly realistic style. Nankoku's painting rejects idealism to portray the image of a living owl. NL NL
At home in the night, an owl sees and hears everything under the moon. Its tufts of feathers are only that: its ears are lower down on its head. Its light-colored eyes hold the promise of day in the dark of night, just as the cherry blossoms portend the coming of spring.
