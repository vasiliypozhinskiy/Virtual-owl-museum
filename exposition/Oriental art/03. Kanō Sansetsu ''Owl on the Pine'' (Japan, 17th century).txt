Kano Sansetsu (1589–1651) was a painter at the early part of the Edo period. His given name was Heishiro Mitsuie. He was born in Hizen Province as a son of Chika Dohgen. Then the family moved to Osaka. When Sansetsu was 16 years old, his father died, and, his uncle asked Kano Sanraku to make Sansetsu a pupil. Kano Sanraku was the founder of the Kyoto Kano school (Kyo-gano). Later, Sanraku admired Sansetsu's talent. Sansetsu married Sanraku's daugher, and was adopted by him. Sansetsu participated in drawing wall paintings with his adopted father. He was ordained as Hokkyo rank. In his last days, he was thrown into jail for some reason. Even though he finally got out of the jail, he died soon at the age of 63.
