Kaoru Kawano (1916–1965) was a Japanese printmaker who worked during the Showa period. Born in Hokkaido in 1916, Kawano studied at the Kawabata Art School during the 1930's and his reputation became international with successful solo exhibitions in North America and elsewhere. His prints frequently depict children and animals, combining Western style elements with the tradition of woodblock printmaking. Kawano’s works are also appreciated for the way in which they incorporate the grain patterns of the woodblock into the design. NL NL
Most popular are his prints depicting owls. Here is one of them, ''The Big Owl'', published and printed in 1950. The picture belongs to the Ukiyo genre. Ukiyo-e is a genre of Japanese art which flourished from the 17th through 19th centuries. Its artists produced woodblock prints and paintings of such subjects as female beauties; kabuki actors and sumo wrestlers; scenes from history and folk tales; travel scenes and landscapes; flora and fauna; and erotica. The term ukiyo-e translates as "picture of the floating world".
