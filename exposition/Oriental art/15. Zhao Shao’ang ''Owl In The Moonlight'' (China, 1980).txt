Zhao Shao’ang was a Chinese artist considered one of the best flower-and-bird painter of his era. Blending impressionistic brushstrokes, blurred areas of color, and moments of descriptive line, Zhao created a sense of animation in all of his subjects. Born in 1905 in Panyu, China, he studied painting under Gao Qifeng as teenager and became a teacher at Fushan Art Academy by the age of 23. Settling in Hong Kong, Zhao was the subject of solo exhibitions in China, Portugal, and New Zealand. The artist died in 1998 in Hong Kong. NL NL
Interestingly, that the owls are called mao-tou-ying (cat-headed hawk) and xiao (bravery) in Chinese. Even though one of the meanings is bravery, the owls are not necessarily accepted in a positive way. Being a night bird, having a superb night vision, ability to move its head relate the owls to mystery, mysticism, secrets, intelligence, and death. The hooting sound of an owl means hu in Chinese, which means digging. It can be seen as the connection of death to the owls. You can see owl figures on the burial ceramics of Han Dynasty. NL NL
When an owl is seen around a house, dried bushes are burned to keep the owl away because of the smell. Also, people put brooms upside down, outside the house to protect the house and the household from the owls as it’s believed that the owls have spiritual powers. That’s why it’s never preferred to attempt to kill or even touch the owl. Another reason to stay away from the owls is the belief that they snatch away the souls. Despite the fear of the owls, in some parts of China, they are associated with the gods of thunder and lightning and therefore, owl effigies are put on top of the roofs for protection. NL NL
In modern China, traditional ideas about owls are being reinterpreted, including through fine paintings by artists.
