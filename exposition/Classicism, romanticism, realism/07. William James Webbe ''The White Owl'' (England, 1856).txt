The painting of Webbe was dedicated to the poem ''The Owl'', written by Alfred Lord Tennyson: NL NL 
When cats run home and light is come, NL 
And dew is cold upon the ground, NL 
And the far-off stream is dumb, NL 
And the whirring sail goes round, NL 
And the whirring sail goes round; NL 
Alone and warming his five wits, NL 
The white owl in the belfry sits. NL NL 
When merry milkmaids click the latch, NL 
And rarely smells the new-mown hay, NL 
And the cock hath sung beneath the thatch NL 
Twice or thrice his roundelay, NL 
Twice or thrice his roundelay; NL 
Alone and warming his five wits, NL 
The white owl in the belfry sits.
