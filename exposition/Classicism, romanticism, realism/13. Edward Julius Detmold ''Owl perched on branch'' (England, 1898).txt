Edward Julius Detmold (1883–1957) and his twin brother Charles Maurice Detmold were prolific Victorian book illustrators. NL NL
Their parents were Edward Detmold and Mary Agnes Luck. Their father, an electrical engineer was chronically ill, and they lived with their uncle and guardian, Dr Edward Barton Shuldham, who saw to their tuition and was a noted collector of porcelain and Japanese woodprints of plants and animals. Dr Shuldham occupied a house in Upper Richmond Road, Putney, where the twins had been born. He ensured their interest in natural history and art, and created a nurturing environment for their precocious talents. They also spent time with another uncle, the painter Henry E. Detmold, who encouraged them in their art. Most of their prodigious energy was expended on depicting animal subjects and their work showed great influence from traditional Japanese art, Albrecht Durer and later the Art Nouveau movement.
