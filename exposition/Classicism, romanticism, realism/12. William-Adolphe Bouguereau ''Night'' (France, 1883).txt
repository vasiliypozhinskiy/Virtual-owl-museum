William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825–1905) was a French academic painter. In his realistic genre paintings he used mythological themes, making modern interpretations of classical subjects, with an emphasis on the female human body. During his life he enjoyed significant popularity in France and the United States, was given numerous official honors, and received top prices for his work. As the quintessential salon painter of his generation, he was reviled by the Impressionist avant-garde. In the 1980s, a revival of interest in figure painting led to a rediscovery of Bouguereau and his work. NL NL
In the late nineteenth century, Bouguereau ranked among the most highly acclaimed artists in Paris. But with the radical development of impressionism, his style quickly fell out of favor. It was deemed by most to be too sentimental and contrived, and his handling of paint was characterized as overly finished. ''La Nuit'' was exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1883. Night, depicted as a partially nude woman floating over the seacoast, offers a light interpretation of an allegorical subject invested with a sensuality and carnality that would have appealed to male audiences.
