'The Night of Enitharmon's Joy'', often referred as ''The Triple Hecate'' or simply ''Hecate'', is a 1795 work of art by the English artist and poet William Blake which depicts Enitharmon, a female character in his mythology, or Hecate, a chthonic Greco-Roman goddess of magic and the underworld.

The image may allude to the Three Fates – the Moirai of Greek mythology and the Parcae of Roman. Notwithstanding these allusions, critics point out that a contemporary trigger for Blake's inspiration probably was the return popularity of Shakespeare's play Macbeth. As Hecate listens offstage, the three witches, in arranging Macbeth's doom, chant: "Double, double, toil and trouble; Fire burn and cauldron bubble". Each witch in turn adds her verses, the second's being: NL NL
"Fillet of a fenny snake, NL
In the cauldron boil and bake; NL
Eye of newt and toe of frog, NL
Wool of bat and tongue of dog, NL
Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting, NL
Lizard's leg and owlet's wing, NL
For a charm of powerful trouble, NL
Like a hell-broth boil and bubble." NL NL
Hence, bat, owl, snake or frog would be appropriate to The Triple Hecate.
