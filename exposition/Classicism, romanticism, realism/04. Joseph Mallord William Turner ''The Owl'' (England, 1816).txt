Joseph Mallord William Turner (1775–1851), known contemporarily as William Turner, was an English Romantic painter, printmaker and watercolourist. He is known for his expressive colourisations, imaginative landscapes and turbulent, often violent marine paintings. NL NL
The image of an owl belongs to watercolour sketches, executed by Turner during his visit to Farnley Hall, the home of Walter Fawrkes in 1810. Fawkes had been Turner's most important patron since about 1803 and had bought a considerable number of his watercolours and oil paintings. Turner agreed to provide Fawkes with the illustrations for his book of ornithology and recorded, in the last year of his life, that the studies had been pasted into an album together with a selection of feathers from each bird illustrated. The feathers were separated from the drawings in 1850 as they were damaging the studies.
