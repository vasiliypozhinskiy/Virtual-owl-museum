Gustav Klimt (1862–1918) was an Austrian symbolist painter and one of the most prominent members of the Vienna Secession movement. Klimt is noted for his paintings, murals, sketches, and other objets d'art. Klimt's primary subject was the female body, and his works are marked by a frank eroticism. Among the artists of the Vienna Secession, Klimt was the most influenced by Japanese art and its methods. NL NL
Pallas Athene uses classical mythology but contrasts markedly from Klimt's more feminine depictions of women. Here, this is a powerful goddess, a woman of strength and courage, sporting traditionally masculine qualities. Gender ambiguities in Greek antiquity were actually very common, not just here in Athena. NL NL
It's contrast from the rest of his career makes this a significant work, whilst at the same time also incorporating common features of his work, such as the bright, gold-leaf artwork and the use of symbolism and greek mythology. NL NL
Here it is Athena's divinity which Klimt finds more interesting, rather than her sexuality, which is not surprising given the gender ambiguities she demonstrated in Greek antiquity. Perhaps Klimt implies that power is a catalyst to sexual instincts, as history has long suggested that power is one of the most important sexual stimuli in human behavior and that the desire for power is strongly connected to sexual desire. In any case, this somewhat asexual Greek goddess becomes Klimt's most powerful female in his art.
