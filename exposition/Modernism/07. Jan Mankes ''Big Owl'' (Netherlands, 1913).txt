To the Dutch artist Jan Mankes (1889–1920), painting was a means to express the ineffable. He studied and sketched his subjects endlessly, until he knew them by heart. Then he painted them from memory, not necessarily as they were, but rather capturing their essence. All of his works show elements of his immediate environment. Besides painting numerous birds and farm animals, he produced dreamy images of the landscape surrounding his parents’ home in Friesland, and views from his studio in Eerbeek. His portraits are seldom flattering, but almost always very sensitive. NL NL
In this oil painting, we see Jan’s own favorite bird, a barn owl, which he kept in his parents’ living room (despite their initial protests). It was given to him by his friend and patron Pauwels, who was in the habit of providing him with all types of birds, particularly birds of prey. Jan let him know how much he admired the owl: ‘A truly miraculous animal, in shape, hues and character; all together an idyll.’ In order to convey this idyll, he used a glazing technique, where many transparent layers of color are applied onto an opaque base, creating soft lines and a beautiful flow and depth of colors. It lends a fairytale-like quality to the owl, who seems self-assured and very much at ease, sitting on his parents’ folding screen. NL NL
Regrettably, Jan Mankes died of tuberculosis at the early age of just 30. Nonetheless, he left behind an impressive oeuvre of about 200 paintings and a large number of drawings and prints.
