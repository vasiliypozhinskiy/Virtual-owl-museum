Francis Bacon (1909–1992) was an Irish-born British figurative painter known for his emotionally charged raw imagery. He produced series of images of popes, crucifixions and portraits of close friends, with abstracted figures sometimes isolated in geometrical cages, set against flat, nondescript backgrounds. NL NL
In the early 1950s, the proximity to lens-based imagery and its aesthetics is palpable in the candid camera poses and the sombre colour schemes of Bacon’s paintings. He feverishly experimented with new subjects and styles, and in 1957 stunned the art world with an explosion of colour, applying vivid shades of red, green, yellow and blue in his variations on Van Gogh’s masterpieces.

Bacon explored a wide range of subjects from exotic animals such as elephants, polar bears and monkeys to dogs and owls. Suited businessmen featured in his imagery as well as the eminent popes, crouching nudes and the death mask of William Blake; they were often painted in series or loosely related groups. NL NL
The strange owls on two sheets relate to a complex personal iconography developed by Bacon, the religious aspects of which are powerfully suggested by the inscription: ''Collapsed image of Christ. Pool of Flesh''. Like the drawings themselves, this may be an annotation to be pursued in his paintings.
