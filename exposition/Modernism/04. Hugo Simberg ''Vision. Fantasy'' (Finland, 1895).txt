Hugo Gerhard Simberg (1873–1917) was a Finnish symbolist painter and graphic artist. NL NL
His works feature a gallery of fantasy characters, including angels, devils and Death, depicted in an inimitable fashion. In addition to fantasy subjects, Simberg’s wide-ranging oeuvre includes portraits and landscapes, which also feature, as an undertone, the artist’s quest to uncover another world beyond reality.

Simberg's paintings emphasize mainly macabre and supernatural topics. A good example is ''Death Listens'', which depicts Death, personified as a skeleton wearing a black coat, listening with a bowed head as a young man plays the violin. In the background is an old woman lying on a bed, pale and apparently sickly. There is a suggestion that Death is there for the old woman, but that he is pausing so the young man, possibly the dying woman's son, can have time to finish his violin playing.
