Paul Jouve was from a very early age attracted to the art of drawing. His father Auguste Jouve, a painter and ceramic artist encouraged him, introducing him to the museums and the Jardin des Plantes where he developed a passion for large wild animals. Preferring drawing from nature to the teaching provided at the Ecole des Arts Decoratifs and the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, he visited assiduously the Jardin des Plantes, the horse market and abattoirs that were very close to his father’s studio. At the same time, fascinated by the work of the Flemish engravers, he became interested in lithography and learned this technique in the studio of the lithographer Henry Patrice Dillon. NL NL
All his life, he was fascinated by animals. In his works he always distance them from any tense situation or brutality and depicts them for themselves, with great benevolence, as our painting shows.
