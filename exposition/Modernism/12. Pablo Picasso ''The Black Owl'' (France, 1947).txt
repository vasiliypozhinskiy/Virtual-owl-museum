Pablo Ruiz Picasso (1881–1973) was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist and theatre designer who spent most of his adult life in France. Regarded as one of the most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of constructed sculpture, the co-invention of collage, and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore.

Owls can be found throughout Picasso's career, in all manner of styles and mediums. Perched high above the Mediterranean coastline, an owl sat inside the medieval ramparts of the Musee d’Antibes – home and studio to Picasso and his muse Francoise Gilot for six months in 1946. It was daytime, an odd time for the famed nocturnal predator to be soaking in the view. In her autobiography, Gilot famously records that: "One of his claws had been injured. We bandaged it and it gradually healed. We bought a cage for him and when we returned to Paris we brought him back with us and put him in the kitchen… He smelled awful and ate nothing but mice." It was the beginning of an unlikely companionship between Picasso and his feathered friend. Francoise goes on to fondly recall their combative relationship – whenever the bird bit Picasso's fingers, the great artist would hurl equally biting verbal abuse back at the bird. NL NL
This love for owls seems to have been influenced by his love for classical themes. The owl possibly (with this context in mind) represents wisdom and intelligence. Picasso was aware of the owl-like quality of his own face. It is worth noting also that in the area where Picasso spent much of his later life the owl had been the traditional symbol of the tribe that had once inhabited the area.
