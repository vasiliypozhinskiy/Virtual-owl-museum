William Degouve de Nuncques (1867–1935) was a Belgian painter. In 1894 he married fellow artist Juliette Massin, who introduced him to the circle of Symbolist poets, who had a considerable influence on his style. He belonged to the avant-garde group Les XX and later exhibited at La Libre Esthetique. NL NL
In painting, symbolism can be seen as a revival of some mystical tendencies in the Romantic tradition, and was close to the self-consciously morbid and private decadent movement. The symbolist painters used mythological and dream imagery. The symbols used by symbolism are not the familiar emblems of mainstream iconography but intensely personal, private, obscure and ambiguous references. NL NL
William Degouve de Nuncques is supposed to have said: "To make a painting, all you need to do is to take some paints, draw some lines, and fill the rest up with feelings."
