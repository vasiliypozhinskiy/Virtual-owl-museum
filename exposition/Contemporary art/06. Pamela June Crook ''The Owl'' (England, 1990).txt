Pamela June Crook (born 1945), known professionally as P J Crook, is an English painter and sculptor. P J Crook works in a Gloucestershire town, surrounded by beautiful countryside. Her works are particularly striking, especially focusing on wildlife, although she covers a huge range of subjects, from a rather frightening work likening the tsunami in Japan to the Pamplona bull run to crowds of sinister people reading newspapers with catchy headlines.

P J drew a series of paintings depicting owls. ''I work mainly at night,'' she told. ''So the nocturnal aspect of owls appealed to me. I also liked the idea of a countryside creature entering an urban environment. Normally you only glimpse an owl flitting by. There’s something ghostly, even angelic about it.'' NL NL
All her works have an instant appeal but, as you look closer, often reveal more unsettling aspects. The painting of an owl in a city centre, where it would not normally venture, perfectly captures this unease.
