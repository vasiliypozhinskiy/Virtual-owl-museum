The artist says: ''I am fascinated by the power of art, and how a single painting can dramatically alter the way we see our surroundings. How everyday things can gain immense beauty simply because we’ve experienced them through someone else’s eyes. That is the magic behind the paint brush. Whether that’s the grit of city living, the diverse world of plants and animals, or anything in between, art offers us a chance to see our planet differently, as the artist and the viewer… As a longtime city dweller, and a lifetime animal lover and advocate, my ambition has been to capture the fleeting moments in my life, using this medium as an opportunity to see the world with a more colorful perspective. Translating my day to day experiences, the emotional connection to those memories, as well as exploring the beauty of nature through animal portraiture and Plein Air Painting has become the sole drive of everything that I create.''
