In the presented picture are depicted laughing owls. The laughing owl (Sceloglaux albifacies), also known as whekau or the white-faced owl, is an extinct endemic owl of New Zealand. Plentiful when European settlers arrived in New Zealand, its scientific description was published in 1845, but it was largely or completely extinct by 1914. The species was formerly considered to belong to the monotypic genus Sceloglaux Kaup ("scoundrel owl", probably because of the mischievous-sounding calls), although recent genetic studies indicate that it belongs with the boobook owls in the genus Ninox.

The laughing owl's plumage was yellowish-brown striped with dark brown. White straps were on the scapulars, and occasionally the hind neck. Mantle feathers were edged with white. The wings and tail had light-brown bars. The tarsus had yellowish to reddish-buff feathers. The facial disc was white behind and below the eyes, fading to grey with brown stripes towards the centre. The eyes were very dark orange. Its length was 35.5–40 cm and wing length 26.4 cm, with males being smaller than females. Weight was around 600 g.
