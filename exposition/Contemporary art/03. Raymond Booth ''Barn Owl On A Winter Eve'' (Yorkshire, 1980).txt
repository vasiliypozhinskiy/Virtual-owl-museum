The botanical painter Raymond Booth was rarely leaving his native Yorkshire, and grew up most of the plants he was painting in his garden there. He typically kept paintings in the studio for years and released them in batches to the London gallery only when his painting room was so crowded with work that he can barely squeeze into it. NL NL
Booth often drew the barn owls. The barn owl has acute hearing, with ears placed asymmetrically. This improves detection of sound position and distance and the bird does not require sight to hunt. The facial disc plays a part in this process, as is shown by the fact that with the ruff feathers removed, the bird can still locate the source in azimuth but fails to do so in elevation. Hunting nocturnal or crepuscular, this bird can target its prey and dive to the ground, penetrating its talons through snow, grass or brush to seize small creatures with deadly accuracy. NL NL
Compared to other owls of similar size, the barn owl has a much higher metabolic rate, requiring relatively more food. Weight for weight, barn owls consume more rodents – often regarded as pests by humans – than possibly any other creature. This makes the barn owl one of the most economically valuable wildlife animals for agriculture. Farmers often find these owls more effective than poison in keeping down rodent pests, and they can encourage barn owl habitation by providing nest sites.
