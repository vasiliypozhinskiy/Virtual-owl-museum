Jean Haines is a watercolour artist known for her loose, expressive style who regularly exhibits her paintings and hosts watercolour workshops for artists from all over the world. NL NL
The artist says: ''I work in a loose interpretative style, capturing the essence of a subject with stunning colour combinations. I studied Chinese brushwork whilst living in Asia so the freedom of working without the use of a preliminary sketch enables me to bring life into my results that would be restricted otherwise by pencil lines. I fall in love with a subject initially, then with a few simple brushtrokes tell the story in a way that is pleasing. And I am a watercolour addict!'' NL NL
Jean Haines often uses the image of an owl for giving demonstrations on how to paint eyes and then works away from a starting point to create the whole subject. Because of the way she works she often chooses to leave out many sections so that the viewer of my finished painting can add detail as they wish through their own imaginations.
