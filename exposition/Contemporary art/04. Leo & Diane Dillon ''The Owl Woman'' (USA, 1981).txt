Leo Dillon (1933–2012) and Diane Dillon (born 1933) were American illustrators of children's books and adult paperback book and magazine covers. One obituary of Leo called the work of the husband-and-wife team "a seamless amalgam of both their hands". In more than 50 years they created more than 100 speculative fiction book and magazine covers together as well as much interior artwork. Essentially all of their work in that field was joint. NL NL
Diane and Leo Dillon first crossed paths in 1953 while attending college together. They met at the beginning of a vital time for change; the following decades would precipitate a revolution towards progressive values, civil rights, and social equality – and the design profession would not be excluded. This was an era when all the faces in children’s books were white, but thanks to the Dillons, that was about to change. "We’re an interracial couple, and we decided early in our career that we wanted to represent all races and show people that were rarely seen in children’s books at the time," Leo said in a 2002 joint interview.

Leo was the first Black Caldecott award-winner. For the book "Ashanti to Zulu: African Traditions" the couple wanted to portray differences in culture within one country, showing that people are different no matter where you are. It highlighted their hallmark ability to incorporate comprehensive and painstaking detail shines through: each picture includes a dwelling, a man, woman, and child, an artifact, an animal, a landscape, and a bird representative of the regional culture.

The painting "The Owl Woman" from that era refers to works in the style of "retro-renaissance".
