Catherine Nolin is a full time painter living in Andover, MA. Through the use of familiar objects, she creates moments in time that, she hopes, have meaning for the viewer. Much of her inspiration comes from the exquisite designs found in the natural world and from spirituality. NL NL
About the painting the artist says: ''Love Barn Owls – any owls really! I've spotted a few near my home by the river. This piece is painted on cradled wood panel with painted sides''. NL NL
The barn-owls' main characteristic is the heart-shaped facial disc, formed by stiff feathers which serve to amplify and locate the source of sounds when hunting. Further adaptations in the wing feathers eliminate sound caused by flying, aiding both the hearing of the owl listening for hidden prey and keeping the prey unaware of the owl. Barn-owls overall are darker on the back than the front, usually an orange-brown colour, the front being a paler version of the back or mottled, although considerable variation is seen even within species.
