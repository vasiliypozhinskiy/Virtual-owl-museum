Madeline von Foerster (born in San Francisco) is an American artist who resides in Germany. To create her unique paintings, Madeline von Foerster uses a five century-old mixed technique of oil and egg tempera, developed by the Flemish Renaissance Masters. Although linked stylistically to the past, her paintings are urgently relevant to the Anthropocene, exploring the human relationship to nature with such themes as deforestation, wildlife trafficking, and human-caused extinction.

As the artist herself says: "A continuing theme in my art is my fascination with things that frighten, or used to frighten me. As a child, I would purposely, and enjoyably, scare myself, by peeking at pictures of barn owls. Their white faces and impossibly dark eyes made me think they were related to ghosts. Now, perhaps predictably, they are my favorite birds! Their heart-shaped faces now seem innocent and adorable to me. This painting is an expression of my love for this unique creature." NL NL
Von Foerster's artworks are in public and private collections around the world and have been featured in numerous publications, including "100 Painters of Tomorrow".
