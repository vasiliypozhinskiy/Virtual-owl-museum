Susan Jamison’s feminine iconography spans several media, including painting, drawing, textile based sculpture, and installation, all steeped in ritualistic and mythological associations. She is best known for her intricate egg tempera paintings, which present a mystery cult of florid women who foray into the wild and commune with animal spirit guides or familiars. The work in series ''Offerings'' admits the viewer into a rarified dimension of beauty based on rituals: the eternal labor of creativity, the gnostikos within ancient lore, and the animal power of the aging Mother we call Earth, depicted as a mystical crone.

The owl spirit animal represents the deep connection that you share with wisdom, good judgment, and knowledge. Like the owl, which is known for its sharp vision and keen observation, you also possess insight and intuition. The meaning of the owl also has something to do with change or transition. It denotes an approaching event that will affect life as you know it. This change may not be that huge, but it can push you to leave old habits behind and grab the opportunity to create new and healthy ones. This can also usher in newer and better things that can improve your life and take it to a new direction. The owl totem also means that you can see beyond the masks that people wear. You can crack through the facade and determine which people have the best and most noble intentions from those who have not.
