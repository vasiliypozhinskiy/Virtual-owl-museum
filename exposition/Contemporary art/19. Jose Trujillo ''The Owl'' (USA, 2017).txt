Jose Trujillo is a self-taught artist, who became interested in light, color, and motion at a very young age. As a young artist, he began visiting museums and studying the paintings of the old masters, finding that he was drawn to the Impressionist’s ''blurry'' view of the world. Observing the color and style of these paintings transformed how he looked at my world. After viewing the Impressionist artwork, he was unable to view the majestic skies of Arizona without spending hours contemplating their beauty. NL NL
