Peter Vos was a painter based in Amsterdam. On the paintings of Peter Vos animals and more particular birds are the main protagonists. A few years ago, Vos started to paint night creatures. Among them are a series of owls depicted in hues of white, grey and brown. NL NL
The paintings have a delicateness about them, in the execution as well as in the subject matter. They are made with much precision and dedication. Over the years, Vos developed a unique painting style in which he uses thin layers of oil paint to create subtle colour nuances. The large planes of colour and geometrical shapes in all his works reflect an accent on painting as such. The representation, in the form of birds stems from a personal fascination and Vos’ knowledge of this species in all its variations is inherent in the paintings. NL NL
The birds are, however, shown without any reference to their natural habitat our surroundings. Mostly they are even flattened in the picture plane through the use of abstracted elements. Framed in close-up, Vos portrays them one by one with their specific idiosyncratic traits and behaviours, as true individuals. With the focus on their facial expressions and mostly the eyes they seem to have almost human-like characteristics.
