ROA (born c. 1976) is a graffiti and street artist from Ghent, Belgium. Internationally, he has created works on the streets of cities across Europe, the United States, Australia, Asia, New Zealand and Africa. ROA generally paints wild or urban animals and birds that are native to the area being painted. ROA usually uses a minimal color pallet, such as black, white, but also creates works using vibrant colours depicting the flesh or internal systems within the animals and birds. NL NL
After months and months of painting all over the world, globetrotting street artist ROA is finally back in his home country. He didn’t rest much as he’s already back painting with this stunning new owl that just appeared on the streets of Hasselt for the Street Art Festival Belgium.
