Sydney-based artist Leah Fraser creates lyrical paintings and ceramics that engage with history, magic and the unknown in their metaphorical visualisation of the ''waters of life''. Drawing inspiration from folk mythologies, diverse cultures and children’s tales, Fraser’s paintings depict shaman-like characters travelling through mystic lands in search of spiritual metamorphosis. Decorated in ritualistic clothing and plants in a ceremonial splendour, the figures have a deep respect for and understanding of the natural world, prompting the viewer to contemplate their own (dis)connection with nature.

''This body of work is about the power and influence of water and the stars and the moon,'' explains Leah. ''It is an extension of my interest in different cultural practices, magic and religion, and particularly of shaman – healers across cultures. Using all these influences, I think I patch together this imaginary world of my own, through which the characters move, decorated in ceremonial splendour, often armed with ritualistic weaponry or instruments and with their wildlife companions, on sort of magical journeys or vision quests''.

The picture ''She won a wager with the sky'' shows a morepork. The morepork (Ninox novaeseelandiae), also called the ruru or Tasmanian spotted owl, is a small brown owl found throughout New Zealand and Tasmania. It has dark brown plumage with prominent pale spots, and golden-yellow eyes. It is generally nocturnal, though is sometimes active at dawn and dusk, retiring to roost in secluded spots in the foliage of trees. The morepork feeds on insects and small vertebrates, hunting by pouncing on them from tree perches.
