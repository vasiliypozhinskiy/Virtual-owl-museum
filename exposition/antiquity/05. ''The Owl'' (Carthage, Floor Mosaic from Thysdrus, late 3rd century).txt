An owl surrounded by birds. The inscription says: ''The birds are torn apart by envy and the owl doesn't care''. NL NL
The mosaic was discovered in a bath house complex, and it displays the insignia of the Telegenii, a group of local showmen and performers at Thysdrus, who very clearly felt proud of their status and their organisation – in fact so proud that they must have deemed themselves immune to jealousy and attacks of those who tried to outperform them in terms of spectacle.

The owl in the mosaic – a proud Roman citizen rather than any kind of migratory fowl – is not bothered, neither in it’s musive depiction nor according to the text itself: ''neque noctua curat''.
