There are many examples of these great monuments and temples throughout Egypt from the pyramid complex at Giza in the north to the temple at Karnak in the south. Among these, the mortuary temple of Queen Hatshepsut (1479–1458 BCE) at Deir el-Bahri stands out as one of the most impressive. NL NL
Owl and water jar hieroglyph characters are depicted on the wall of the second terrace of the Mortuary temple of Hatshepsut, in the necropolis of thebes on the west bank at luxor. Hooting of the owls was regarded an ill omen. In Ancient Egypt, if a lowly official received the glyph of an owl from the pharaoh, it was understood that the recipient had to take his own life. NL NL
The Ancient Egyptian Owl represents the sound and letter M in the Hieroglyphic alphabet, and was used frequently in writing. The owl was one of the sacred symbols often found carved and painted on papyrus, monuments, and temples of the Kings, Queens, and Nobles of Kemet. NL NL
The bird typically depicted in tomb paintings and monuments is the Egyptian Barn Owl. The Eagle Owl was also used at times for the M hieroglyph, and over the course of millenia, the hieroglyph sometimes appeared to be a combination of both birds, having the white body, yellow-brown wings, and white face of the Barn Owl, and the darker head and pointed brown ear tufts of the Eagle Owl.
