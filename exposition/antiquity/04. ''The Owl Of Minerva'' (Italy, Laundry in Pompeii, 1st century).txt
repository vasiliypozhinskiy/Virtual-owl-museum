A primarily important activity in Pompeii was the fullonica – the laundry. Throughout the city there were at least 13 workshops working raw wool, 7 for spinning and weaving, 9 for dyeing, and 18 for washing. Laundries were used both for finishing fabric by scrubbing the dirt collected during spinning and weaving processes, and for clothes washing and stain removal. It’s important since Romans took extreme care in the cleanliness of their white tunics. NL NL
According to Pliny the Elder, the work of fullones was taken very seriously. Fullones were legally responsible for the clothes they were washing. Fullones were subject to penalties if they returned the wrong clothes or damaged the clothes. Furthermore, clothes once washed were considered devalued. In fact, Emperor Elagabalus said that he would not touch linen that had been washed because such cloth had already been devalued. NL NL
Roman launderers worshipped the goddess Minerva, as did many other professions. Therefore, the fullones were particularly involved with Quinquatrus, Minerva’s main feast held on March 19. The feast often took place in a fullo's workshops. Fullones are associated with representations of owls, such as in Roman graffiti found in Pompeii.
