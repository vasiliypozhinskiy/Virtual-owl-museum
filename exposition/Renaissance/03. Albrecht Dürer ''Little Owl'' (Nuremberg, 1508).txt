Albrecht Durer (1471–1528) was a German painter, printmaker, and theorist of the German Renaissance. Born in Nuremberg, Durer established his reputation and influence across Europe when he was in his twenties due to his high-quality woodcut prints. He was in communication with the major Italian artists of his time, including Raphael, Giovanni Bellini and Leonardo da Vinci. NL NL
His watercolours also mark him as one of the first European landscape artists, while his ambitious woodcuts revolutionized the potential of that medium. Durer's introduction of classical motifs into Northern art, through his knowledge of Italian artists and German humanists, has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance. This is reinforced by his theoretical treatises, which involve principles of mathematics, perspective, and ideal proportions. Albrecht Durer has been credited with inventing the basic principle of ray tracing, a technique used in modern computer graphics. NL NL
''Little Owl'' was a predominantly watercolour painting, there was also use of gouache and pen in order to bring out certain details of the owl and add lighting effects. The sharp talons are similar to elements of Durer’s work with insects but the artist goes against the normal use of owls as symbols of the dangers of the night. He prefers an honest, somewhat charming portrait which communicates his respect for this creature's beauty.
