The painting "A man with an owl looking through a stone arch" belongs to the brush of an unknown artist, one of the followers of Hans von Aachen. Hans von Aachen was a German painter best known for his depictions of allegorical and mythological scenes in a Northern Mannerist style. Von Aachen’s works feature uniquely smooth paint application and focus on the integrity of forms and tonal masses, which was a hallmark of Netherlandish Renaissance painters. NL NL
Little is known about the significance of this painting today. The inscription under the picture refers to a famous proverb and translated from Dutch means: "In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king". A squinting person can be associated with the ability of owls to wink. It should also be noted that in the Netherlands, the owl was a symbol of trickery and stupidity.
