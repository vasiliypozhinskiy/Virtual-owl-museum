Cornelis Bloemaert II (1603–1692) was a Dutch Golden Age painter and engraver. Bloemaert was born at Utrecht. Though originally trained as a painter, he devoted himself primarily to printmaking. He went to Paris in 1630, where he made engravings from among others, Michel de Marolles's Temple des Muses, before going to Rome in 1633. His chisel can be recognised by the colours' richness and the smoothness of their transitions. NL NL
''The Wise Owl'' is a satire with an owl wearing spectacles standing on a closed book, beside him a candle rests on an open book. The Dutch profanity word "uilskuiken" ("owl chick") is used to insult a stupid person and reminds people of the opposite view of owls. The painting has many inscriptions. The text below is in Dutch and reads "Wat baet keers off bril, als den WL niet sien en Wil" which translates as "What use are a candle and glasses if the owl refuses to see?". It is an old expression which means that it is useless to advice someone if he does not want to listen. The book on which the owl is sitting has a page on which the text "It concerns profit" is written ("T'is omt profyt") while the Bible on the right has the text "Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not steal".
