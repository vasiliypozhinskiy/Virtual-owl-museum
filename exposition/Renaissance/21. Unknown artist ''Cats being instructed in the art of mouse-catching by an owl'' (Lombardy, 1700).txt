The painting by an unknown artist ''Cats being instructed In the art of mouse-catching by an owl'' belongs to the Lombard School and has several interpretations. First, it can parody the plot of the famous bird concerts of the Baroque era. This picture shows a concert of cats and owl: both nocturnal creatures. This may be a playful joke painting, commenting on noisy night animals and their screeching in the dark. The mice are supposed to be the notes that they are following. NL NL
The second interpretation offers a different meaning. Some cats are playing music while others learn mouse-catching from the owl. The center cat has around its neck some sort of pendant or watch fob or something, with a unique marking of mouse. One cat on the right is wearing glasses, in order to read, and a group of cats on the left of the image appear aghast at what the owl is telling them. Perhaps this is a reference to the parable: owl teaching cats to catch mice, though both animals known for their mice-catching. Various parables and proverbs are recalled, like ''The blind leading the blind''. Perhaps something similar is happening here; some unknown Italian proverb warning about the cats taking lessons from the owl on how to catch mice. NL NL
Finally, there is the view that the picture is a political or religious parody of public figures of the era.
