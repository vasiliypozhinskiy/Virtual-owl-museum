Juan de Flandes (1460–1519) was a Flemish painter active in Spain from 1496 to 1519. His actual name is unknown. He worked in the Early Netherlandish style. The artist is only documented after he became a painter at the court of Queen Isabella I of Castile, where he is first mentioned in the accounts in 1496. He is described as "court painter" and continued in the queen's service until her death. NL NL
''The Nativity'' is one of the six surviving panels of an altarpiece from the main chapel in the Church of San Lazaro in northern Castile. Juan's Nativity, as with many religious scenes, amplifies a biblical episode with theological references. The Gospel of Luke writes that the baby was wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger. Here, however, the child is naked and lies on his mother's robe upon the ground, implying that the son of god was poorer than the humblest son of man. Meanwhile, illuminating the starry night, concentric rings of divine light emanate from the angel appearing to the shepherds on the distant hilltop. Perched on the ruined stable, an owl may refer to the nocturnal darkness dispelled by the coming of Christ.
