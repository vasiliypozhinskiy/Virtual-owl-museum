In this print two owls are pictured skating on ice, each in seventeenth-century dress and carrying a mouse attached to a string. The print has the caption ''Hoe dienen wiy bij een! '' (''How well we go together''). This engraving is an example of ''the upside down world'' – a world in which animals are behaving like humans. The cracking ice emphasizes the trouble that both owls face: the male owl is in danger of having an unfaithful wife and the female owl is in peril of drowning eternally for her sins. Given that owls were associated with the night and sinister activities, their representation in a human guise would have reinforced the disturbing implications.
