The theme of a concert of birds was rarely treated by Hondecoeter, and there are only few examples of works in Hondecoeter’s oeuvre. Hondecoeter is considered the most important Dutch bird painter of the 17th century. Because of his masterful rendering of the birds’ colourful plumage, be became a model for many of his contemporaries, who called him the “Raphael of Animals”. NL NL
Melchior frequently sought to render the climax of a fight or duel, thereby transferring human emotions to the realm of animals. The fragmentary impression of the painter’s compositions, in which objects are seemingly arbitrarily cropped at the margins, is characteristic of these escalating scenes. Similar to snapshots taken with a camera, they suggest the momentariness of a situation. Hondecoeter succeeds in conveying this all the more intensively, the more he approximates the vanishing point to the eye level of the birds depicted – a device frequently employed by him. In this way, the painter manages to directly involve the spectator into the drama of the scene.
