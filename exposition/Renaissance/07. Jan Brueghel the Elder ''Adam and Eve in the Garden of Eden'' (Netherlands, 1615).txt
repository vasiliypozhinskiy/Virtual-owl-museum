Jan Brueghel the Elder (1568–1625) was a Flemish painter and draughtsman. He was the son of the eminent Flemish Renaissance painter Pieter Brueghel the Elder. NL NL
Brueghel worked in many genres including history paintings, flower still lifes, allegorical and mythological scenes, landscapes and seascapes, hunting pieces, village scenes, battle scenes and scenes of hellfire and the underworld. He was an important innovator who invented new types of paintings such as flower garland paintings, paradise landscapes, and gallery paintings in the first quarter of the 17th century. Brueghel represented the type of the pictor doctus, the erudite painter whose works are informed by the religious motifs and aspirations of the Catholic Counter-Reformation as well as the scientific revolution with its interest in accurate description and classification.

According to the Scriptures, the male and female of every species in the world were present in the Garden of Eden, where they had been named by Adam in a universal (pre-Babel) tongue. In theory therefore the whole of pre-Darwinian zoology could be retrieved through a depiction of this subject. This is clearly the spirit in which this work would have been enjoyed; we are invited to recognise and name as many species as we are able. Some of Brueghel’s animals – the horse, lions and leopards – have been copied from paintings by Rubens, but he may have checked them against the real thing or against other images. The elephants perhaps seem to rely on hearsay, but the general standard of zoology is remarkably high. The landscape here tells us what paradise looked like in the imagination of Brueghel and his contemporaries: soft morning light is seen through an interrupted cloud cover, promising an alternation of sunshine and gentle showers; the rolling terrain is a mixture of clearings and woodland (the trees laden with fruit).
