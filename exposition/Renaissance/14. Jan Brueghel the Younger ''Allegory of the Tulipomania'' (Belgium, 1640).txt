The painting depicts an era of the tulipomania – the first economic bubble that took place around 1640 in the Netherlands. During the pinnacle of the tulipomania, a tulip flower bulb was worth as much as a canal house in Amsterdam. But the market for tulip bulbs collapsed and many investors became bankrupt. The phenomenon tulipomania is still mentioned in the economics books and new economic air bubbles. NL NL
Brueghel made a great painting about the phenomenon. On the painting you see a monkey pointing to flowering tulips. Another monkey is holding up a tulip and a moneybag. The deal is closed with a handshake, bulbs are weighed and money is counted, a lavish business diner is being enjoyed. The monkey on the left has a list with the names of expensive tulips. The sword on his side is a symbol of status. In the background a monkey is riding a horse like a gentleman of rank or postion. The monkey in the middle is completing his deal. The owl on his shoulder is – contradictorily – not the usual symbol of wisdom, but a sign of stupidity because this nocturnal creature is blind by day. Brueghel is ridiculing the Tulipmania by depicting the speculators as foolish monkeys.
