David Teniers the Younger or David Teniers II (1610–1690) was a Flemish Baroque painter, printmaker, draughtsman, miniaturist painter, staffage painter, copyist and art curator. He was an extremely versatile artist known for his prolific output. He was an innovator in a wide range of genres such as history painting, genre painting, landscape painting, portrait and still life. Teniers is particularly known for developing the peasant genre, the tavern scene, pictures of collections and scenes with alchemists and physicians. NL NL
The picture shows that a healer or rural doctor treats a peasant’s head with rustic tools. Behind them, a worried woman looks on, while a servant enters with food. The composition is derived from works on the same subject by Teniers’ teacher, Adriaen Brower. The presence of an owl, symbolizing wisdom, may be an illusion to a critical interpretation of what is depicted here. This painting would thus be linked to the tradition of Flemish painting in which surgical operations are frequently ridiculed.
